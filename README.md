Hello and Welcome!

I am a programmer and data analyst from Michigan with additional experience in GIS. I am proficient in Python.  Currently I am earning a cloud development professional certificate and taking a full-stack web development bootcamp.  Building partnerships and trusting relationships has been a fundamental part of my professional career. I love leading coalitions in meaningful missions, presenting and training, and analyzing and solving complex problems. In fact, I have years of experience solving cases that could and did hold up in court.  I focus on details and carefully listen, whether that person is an external stakeholder or a colleague up or down in my organization.  

I also do freelance web development and data analytics for individuals and businesses.
